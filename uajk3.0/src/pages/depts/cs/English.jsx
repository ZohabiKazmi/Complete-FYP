                "English over many decades has been functioning as a Lingua Franca world over and is likely to enjoy this status for another 100 years. In view of this importance, the career opportunities for those graduating in this subject are vast. There is no denying the fact that Linguistics and English Language Teaching have also gained great deal of importance. The Department is fully alive to these modern developments and needs and has, therefore, devised a course, which can meet all these requirements. The course we offer at BS and Masterâ€™s level is unique and has no parallel in the country."

Special attention is given to incorporating latest up-to-date trends and approaches in the research."
